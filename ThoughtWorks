The whole game is driven by HTTP REST APIs. You can read about REST at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer

Few important guidelines:

1. For every API call, pass your UserID as an HTTP header with key "userId". Your userId is <yiz5wXuSC>. If you don't do this step, you will receive an "Invalid user!‚Äù error.

2. For every POST API call, you need to pass "content-type" as "application/json" as well.

3. For every API call, use host as https://http-hunt.thoughtworks-labs.net

 

So how should you start playing?

Hit an endpoint GET https://http-hunt.thoughtworks-labs.net/challenge which would give you further instructions.
