1. Load configuration stored in Global Sheet
2. Load TestCases sheet
3. Check if the first test case [for ex: TC1] flag is set to Y
4. If set to Y then take the total number of instances of TC1 from Test Data sheet, 
	4.a set the iteration counter based on above step
5. Note down the row numbers from which data needs to be passed for each iteration to test case
6. Navigate further in the code to create a loop starting from Test Data sheet , counter = No.of iterations noted in 4.a
7. Run the code further to invoke the refelction API [ Reading each keyword as pkg.classname.methodname]
8. Run first iteration
9. Run remaining iterations
10. Prepare a report for total number of test cases executed as per iterations
