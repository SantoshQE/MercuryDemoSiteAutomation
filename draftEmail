This is to inform you that I am unable to keep my motivation high to work for RBC.
I would like to grab your attention on below points to justify my disinterest 

1. I have served RBC for 3 years with dedication and commitment so now its time to explore new account with new setup and new automation technology stack.
2. I am not willing to work on RBC defined automation frameworks such as SIFT as this limits my ability to explore and implement new automation frameworks such as TestNG,Cucumber etc. 
3. There are good opportunities in other accounts which can help me grow my skill set and fulfill my onsite aspiration.
4. I have been sitting unallocated from past one & half month,not able to upgrade myself on new automation technologies due to lack of live automation projects.
5. Due to recent ramp-down in WM-QA, I am not sure if I can get good band(A) this year as well.
6. I can see resources holding Canada visa from past 1+ years are still working at offshore , this increases uncertainty over  fullfilment of onsite aspiration.
7. Since getting Canada Visa and getting onsite position are 2 different things, I would prefer to go for other options [for ex: UK] where visa processing is not time consuming and
minimal/no chances of Visa rejection also there is an assurity of onsite position mapped to my role/skillset. Not sure if RBC currently have such open positions at those locations.


As discussed before ,this is my humble request to release me from RBC as I do not see any scope to get expertise in new automation technologies 
such as Cucumber,DevOps,testNG-jenkins,mobile automation-Appium, protractor( Angular JS Automation) etc.
and also not motivated enough on fulfilling my onsite aspiration through RBC.
