2. Technology used : Application was developed using html and embedded java objects
3. automation approach based on POC : As the application was build using HTML , we selected selenium as the first open source choice to check application fwasdibilyt, 
POC Conclusion :
1. All the web objects were easily identified using selenium webdriver 
2. We could  automate 1 end to end flow as a part of automation POC using selenium webdriver 

Challenges :
1. windows authentication popup are not easily identified using selenium webdriver so we used webdriver switch , alert and third party tools such as auto it to automate it
2. The application contains a page wherein a PDF file is embedded in webpage and verify the contents --> This is not easy using selenium web driver so we are thinking about third party tool such as PDFBOX

As there is not much data driven flow we have decided to implementa keyword driven framwork using selenium 
other choices are 
1. TestNG
2. TestNG-Page Object Model

5. detail explaination of frameowrk with focus on reporting , integration of frameowork with test mgmt tools such as ALM
